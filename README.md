### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a highly motivated and diligent technical professional with 10+ years 
of experience in logistics, operations management, and people development.
I'm always interested in knowing all the facts about how things work and I truly believe that when you stop learning, you stop living.

After spending over 7 years in logistics working on numerous projects in partnership with the Department of Defense and with the US Tennis Association, I've pivoted to an exciting new journey in cloud computing and software development.
I am currently attending the Tech Elevator Java/HTML/Java script Bootcamp and recently acquired my AWS Practitioner Certification.
