### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I'm currently learning java through the summer cohort at Tech Elevator!
I'm looking forward to learning all about coding and software development along with other technologies that could benefit my new career.
A little about myself: I love to play disc golf and I'm a musician in a couple of bands. My wife and I live on the East Coast with our two dogs and spend as much time outdoors that we possibly can.
